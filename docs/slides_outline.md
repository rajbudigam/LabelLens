Title: LabelLens — Ingredient Intelligence
Purpose & Users: Shoppers + students; instant clarity on additives/allergens/jurisdictions.
Architecture: Next.js app router, client-only, rules in TS modules, no backend.
Functionality: paste → analyze → NOVA, additives, Big-9, US/CA/EU table, PDF export.
Impact: promotes safer, compliant choices; transparent heuristics with caveats.
Limitations: heuristic NOVA; regulatory summaries; always verify labels.
Roadmap: OCR toggle; barcode; region auto-detect; crowdsourced rule tuning.
